``zoom`` is a Python-based integrative framework for linking macroscopic and mesoscopic 
spatial brain phenotypes (SBPs) with microscopic molecular, cellular information. 
ZOOM extends conventional imaging transcriptomics paradigm to further identify cell 
subpopulations or cellular modules associated with SBPs by utilizing information 
derived from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset.
